> [!WARNING]
> This repository is part of the [**`Community Translations for GoldSrc`**](https://github.com/source-br/Community-Translations-for-GoldSrc). It was designed to be used as a submodule of the project's central repository, which should be used to manage this repository.

This project aims to translate the textures, interface and texts of **Ricochet** into other languages that don’t have an official translation, in a community-driven, fan-to-fan way.

These translations are made by the community, and this repository aggregates the textures in an editable `.psd` format. The texts and interface are located in the GoldSrc Community Translations repository.
